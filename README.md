# Reuse of component

As part of structure this site and use of React the reuse of the component is get very important and after creating a site on my own now I get more focus on this very handy feauture of this framework because having this possibility some piece of code that is repeat in different pages can simply been isolate and use as a component everytime need, one example is the CategorySelector component that I create to isolate a form component with label and control to show a list of options to the user in the creation of the product and then reuse in the category filter page to filter the results.
Another component used many time is the Avatar component that itself contain just a bunch of line of code but for his importants and wide use comes very handy.
The use of component resuable coming also more handy for the versatility that we can give adding different props that they can be customise depending on the different case of use.

# Technologies used

## React Bootstrap
- I choose React Bootstrap for the wide choice of customisation and the user-friendliness

## Django Rest Framework
- Framework used to create a database data to work with in the Frontend

## ElephantSQL
- Service of database to migrate my data inherit from DRF

### GitHub
- Used to store my repositories

### Gitpod
- Used to work on my workspace and then add, commit and push on GitHub

### Jwt-decode

- Installed this package to decode the JSON Web Tokens

### Paper.drawio

- Site where I build my wireframes and the flowchart for my backend database organization


# Design

- I choose for this site 2 main color, one light shade of lightblue (#8dc9e1) in the Navbar and a simple white to contrast with the Navbar, the icon are instead a light grey (#555) to give a uniform visual for the user, the active page is recognisible because the icon that represent the page is in a different color (#0000ff), a bright blue simply recognisable.

# Future Feauture

- One new feauture to add can be the possibility to refine the research by price or many other details like color of the product 

- One very useful feature can be also the possibility to have a direct contact between seller and buyer using direct message chat.

# Deployment

- Create a new repositeries with Gitpod, give a name to the app (all lowercase in this case for the creation of the ReactApp succesfully later on )
- Create a React app using the command: npx create-react-app . --use-npm (the name of the app is going to be the name of your repository)
- Start the app with : npm start.
- Opening the preview you should see a React Logo and a text, all of this is store in the App.js.

## Heroku app creation

- Open Heroku and click on New and then Create a new app.
- Insert the name of the app, the region where we are and then create app.
- In the deploy tab select GitHub, the repository that you want to use and then set if you prefere also an automatic deployment everytime we push the code.
- Wait until the build and the deployment is complete and then click on Open app to be sure is succesfully displayed.

## Final deployment

- Add, commit and push all the code
- If is not automatic the deployment make sure to click on manual deployment
- After the deployment click on open app to make sure is everything shown as expected.
